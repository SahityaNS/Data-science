# REGRESSION

Regression analysis produces an equation to describe the relationships between a set of independent variables and the dependent variable. With the help of this equation we can predict the value of dependent variable.

types of regression analysis:

# 1. Linear Regression

  ## Simple Linear Regression
  * Predictions are made using one independent variable
  * It is assumed there is a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.
  * We shall try to find the best fit line that represents the linear function.
  * The equation of the best fit line has the form Y= a + bX
    Y - dependent variable
    X - independent variable
    a - y intercept
          
  * Steps:
    - Data Preprocessing
    - Building a model on training dataset
    - Predicting the result
    - Visualization
